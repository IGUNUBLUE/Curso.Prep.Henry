                <span>
                    As a professional I aim pleased to offer the most qualified service
                    to users. The passion that I have for my work, the will to learn and
                    the experience accumulated in more than 7 years make me the ideal
                    candidate; organized work and self-management are part of the day to
                    day work experiences. In my career as a support technician, honesty,
                    perseverance and attention to detail make me a reliable professional
                    capable of providing the clients with adequate solutions to their
                    needs with optimal response times. In addition, my positive attitude
                    makes the difference in communication and humane treatment that they
                    receive. Working under pressure, resilience and teamwork are part of
                    the additional strengths that as a professional, I can contribute.
                    Last but not least, I express my desire to receive constructive
                    criticism and feedback, since these make me more aware of the
                    shortcomings that I have and correct them. As a personal note, my
                    love for motorcycles, free software and programming languages ​​are
                    adjacent aspects of my personality.
